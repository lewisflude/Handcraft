# Getting Around

When you first start on the server, your first aim should be to move at least 100 blocks away from spawn. 

There are 5 portals at spawn to help you do this. Four of them, the North Warp, East Warp, South Warp and West Warp will teleport you 2500 blocks out in each cardinal direction. 

The final portal is the Random Warp which will teleport you to a random safe location within 2500 blocks of spawn. The Random Warp can only be used once every 10 minutes.
