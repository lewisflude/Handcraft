## Money

Our currency is the Handcraft Dollar and every new player starts with $500. You can earn more money by killing hostile mobs, mining ores that give XP or killing other players. There are rumours that certain mobs drop more coins than others.

You can also sell diamonds for $250 each to the bank in the market district. You can sell as many as you like. This means that when pricing items, thinking of $250 as one diamond's worth of money is a good starting point.

### Commands

## Shop Creation

Create a shop by left clicking a chest with an item you want to sell. You can convert this shop to one that buys items if you want other players to be able to sell you items. Shop plots are available in the market district if you want your shop to be in a high traffic area, but you can make a shop anywhere.
