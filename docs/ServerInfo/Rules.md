# Rules

Rules apply to every player on Handcraft including donators and moderators. If you suspect someone of breaking the rules, please speak to a moderator or admin or post in the #support channel on our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/QVNEExU). The server staff will always try and treat everyone fairly and use their best judgement. In cases where rules are broken, we will always try and make the punishment fit the crime. To appeal a ban/mute please message `Lewis Flude#0001` on Discord.

## Rule 1: Treat others with respect

Make sure you treat other players and staff with respect. Make sure you aren't disrespectful towards other players in chat. Don't kill a player just to upset them. PVP is allowed on Handcraft, but a level of sportsmanship is expected.

## Rule 2: No griefing

Greifing is defined as irritating other players through the use of destruction, construction, or social engineering. This includes (but is not limited to) destroying blocks in someone's build,  placing blocks to purpousely annoy the other player and purpousely claiming land to "block" another player.

## Rule 3: No offensive content

Hate speech and obscene content will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Handcraft is a public space, so please conduct yourself appropriately. Adult content is generally fine as long as it's not offensive., so please try and use good judgement

## Rule 4: No advertising

Links are fine, but advertising websites, services or other game servers is banned both in-game and on the community Discord. If you do have something that falls into these categories that you feel should be shared with the server, please PM a member of staff.

## Rule 5: No cheating (x-ray, afk fishing, flying etc.)

Cheating is defined as anything that you have access to that gives you an unfair advantage. The most obvious example of cheating is using hack clients. Speed hacking, flying, "Jesus hack", x-ray and autoclickers are all examples of things that would be considered cheating. Any sort of in-game item-dupe glitch is considered cheating. We have additionally disabled AFK fish farms as they take little effort to set up for a large reward. Other farms are okay, and we do our best to support technical Minecraft players.
