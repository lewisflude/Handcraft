### Land Claiming

Every player has the ability to claim land. You do this using claim blocks. Each claim block allows you to claim one block of land from bedrock to build limit. So a 10x10 area from bedrock to build limit would cost 100 claim blocks.

Players start with 120 claim blocks and earn 120 more per hour in-game. You can also buy extra claim blocks if you want to claim a larger area.

When you place a chest, the land surrounding it will be automatically claimed and will automatically expand as you expand your build.

You can also change flags on claims you own in order to toggle certain behaviours including whether PVP is allowed, animal spawning, water flow and more!

#### Commands
- `/claim` Start the claiming process
- `/claiminfo` Show information about the claim you are in
- `/claimflag` Set flags in a claim you own
- `/trust <player>` Allow another player to build in your claim
- `/buyblocks <amount>` Buy additional claim blocks for $2/block
