# Handcraft Docs

>Handcraft is a challenging survival server with a classic feel. The server is carefully tuned in order to evoke that feeling of classic Minecraft that was prevalent in the early 2010s. We also try and keep the game challenging as we believe it makes things much more rewarding for the player.
