# Handcraft Docs

>Handcraft is a challenging survival server with a classic feel. The server is carefully tuned in order to evoke that feeling of classic Minecraft that was prevalent in the early 2010s. We also try and keep the game challenging as we believe it makes things much more rewarding for the player.

You can join the server at `play.handcraftmc.org`.

Handcraft is currently running on Minecraft Java Edition version `1.15.2`. We use [Paper](https://papermc.io/), a fork of [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) and have heavily configured the server for optimal performance.

For support, questions or suggestions please get in touch with an admin in [our community Discord](https://discord.gg/QVNEExU). We frequently share updates and solicit player feedback on changes we're thinking of implementing. It's also a great place to talk to other players outside of the game.

This document contains a list of the commands you can use within Handcraft and is split into 6 distinct categories.
